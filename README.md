# Cryptocurrencies

**Overview of the Project**
For this project, Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked me to create a report that includes the cryptocurrencies currently on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the new investment.

Our data for this analysis is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, it is decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. We’ll use data visualizations to share relevant findings with the board of Accountability Accounting.

**Results: Four Deliverables**

- Deliverable 1: Process the Data for PCA
